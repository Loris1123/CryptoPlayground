# CryptoPlayground
I'm attending some crypto lessons at university, at the moment.
To learn the stuff a bit more I decided to create this small playground
where I will implement some things I heard during the lecture.
It will  probably not be useful for anybody and it might be ugly or not correct implement.  
So be aware **NOT** to use this code in any serious crypto software. This is just for me to play around and learn how it works.

I've chosen Rust as a language for no specific reason. I just wanted to learn the language.

## How to use
Use the following arguments to choose what you want to do

    Options:
        -h, --help          Print this helptext
            --feistel       Start Feistel encryption
            --lfsr          Start LFSR

## Todo
 - GCD (Euklid)
 - Some Hashes
 - Maybe more.. Whatever comes to my mind
