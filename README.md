# CryptoPlayground
I'm attending some crypto lessons at university, at the moment.
To learn the stuff a bit more I decided to create this small playground
where I will implement some things I heard during the lecture.
It's probably not useful to anybody.

I've chosen Rust as a language for no deep reason. I just want to learn the language.
